# Get Corpus Data

Corpus data files are `CSV` files in a specific format (__machine learning corpus format__). A collection of them have been prepared for this workshop. Download them and then upload them to the `./corpora` folder in your Binder repository. Sorry that the process is not more direct!

Corpus data may be downloaded from the following shared Dropbox link:

* [TAPI Corpora Directory](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t6im8ni921gxinr/AADL_-VPetjmDIMO3vYAFvNRa?dl=0)  

Additionally, these files may be downloaded individually:

* [Wine Reviews](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rszsd6t30c0n3y/winereviews-tapi.csv?dl=0) &mdash; A collection of terse wine reviews.
* [JSTOR Hyperparameter](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uoa8191px405fj0/jstor_hyperparameter-tapi.csv?dl=0) &mdash; Abstracts from a JSTOR search for "hyperparameter." 
* [Tamilnet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dtqnzcbkcp07u5e/tamilnet-tapi.csv?dl=0) &mdash; A sample of news stories from the website Tamilnet.
* [Anphoblach](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lrmt92q59npx0x5/anphoblacht-tapi.csv?dl=0) &mdash; A sample of news stories from the website Anphoblacht.


Each link goes to a Dropbox item that has a download link. Download the file to your desktop and then upload to the appropriate directory.

# Get Sample Output Data

The notebooks in this workshop will generate a __digital analytical edition__ from a given source corpus file. The results of the various analytical processes will be put in the `./db` directory. A demonstration edition is provided for one of the notebooks. To get the demo data, download then upload the files with the prefix `jstor_hyperparameter_demo` into to your `./db` directory.
